# Glossary

* **Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)**: Used by a router to announce its MAC address in a beacon signal.
* **Brute force attack**: An attack that involves trying all possible authentication combinations to find a match.
* **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Confidentiality:</span> Ensuring sensitive information is protected from access by unauthorized persons.
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Integrity</span>: Protecting information from being modified or tampered by unauthorized persons.
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Availability:</span> Ensuring that all operating systems, equipment, and data are functioning correctly and accessible by those who need it.
* **Code injection**: Type of attack that injects code that is then interpreted and executed by the target application.
* **Cybersecurity**: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">assessment of threats</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">mitigation of risk</span>
* **Dorking**: Aka [Google Hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking), using custom google queries to find security holes in websites and code
* **Enumeration** The process of gathering data for a specific network, usually for the purpose of finding ways to gain access into that network.
* **Keylogger**: A program designed to record which keys are pressed on your computer keyboard. It can obtain passwords or encryption keys and use these to bypass security measures.
* **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** Network layer protocol used by devices to diagnose network communication issues. A ping uses ICMP to send an echo request to a specific IP address and waits on a reply
* **Malware**: Hardware, software, or firmware meant to perform an unauthorized process that will compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system (e.g., a virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entity that infects a host).
* **Man-in-middle attack (MitM)**: An attack where the adversary positions themself between the user and the system so that they can intercept and alter data traveling between them.
* **Packet sniffer**: Software that monitors network traffic on wired or wireless networks and captures packets. Packet sniffers are used by network managers to monitor and analyze traffic, but hackers also use them.
* **Ping (Packet Inter-Network Groper)**: Utility used to determine whether a host is operating and responding to echo requests.
* **Phishing attack**: A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, usernames, or passwords, through fraudulent solicitation (e.g., email). The perpetrator pretends to be a reputable business or person.
* **Risk**: Possibility of losing something valuable
* **Risk analysis**: Understanding the risks faced by an organization, which are most severe, and which are most likely.
* **Risk Management**: Using the results of risk analysis to create a plan for preventing likely risks.
* **Risk mitigation**: The process of reducing the impact of a negative event, and/or the likelihood that it will reoccur.
* **Routing:** The act of choosing the path that traffic takes in or across networks.
* **Social engineering**: The act of deceiving an individual into revealing sensitive information, obtaining unauthorized access, or committing fraud by gaining confidence and trust.
* **Threat**: An actor that might exploit a vulnerability
* **Threat assessment**: A structured process of identifying the risks posed to a group or system.
* **Threat Modelling**: Determining which attacks an organization is most likely to experience, who is most likely to launch them, and what actions can be done to prevent them.
* **Vulnerability**: is an aspect of a business that can be exploited to compromise a systemâ€™s CIA Triad
* **Wireless Access Point (WAP):** Networking hardware device that connects a wireless network to a wired network.
* **WiFi:** The type of wireless technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless internet and network connections.
