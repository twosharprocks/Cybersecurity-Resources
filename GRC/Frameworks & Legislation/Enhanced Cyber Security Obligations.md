## Enhanced Cyber Security Obligations



## Systems of National Significance (SoNS)  

Some critical infrastructure assets will be declared a [System of National Significance (SoNS) (172KB PDF)](https://www.cisc.gov.au/resources-subsite/Documents/cisc-factsheet-systems-of-national-significance-enhanced-cyber-security-obligations.pdf). These assets are the most crucial to the nation, due to the cascading consequences that may occur if disrupted.

Entities responsible for SoNS may need to meet Enhanced Cyber Security Obligations (ECSO). These are in addition to the obligations listed above.

Which ECSO apply to a SoNS asset can depend on the circumstances for the sector and similar assets. We recognise that different sectors have different networks and systems, and could face different risks.

The Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs (the Secretary) must consider a number of factors when deciding which ECSO to apply to each responsible entity, including:

-   the likely cost to the affected entity of complying with the obligations
-   the reasonableness and proportionality of the decision
-   any other matter the Secretary considers relevant.

ECSOs can only be applied to SoNS, not critical infrastructure more broadly.  
  

## Enhanced Cyber Security Obligations (ECSO)

There are four ECSO which can be applied to SoNS.

For more detailed information about the ECSO, read the [Enhanced Cyber Security Obligations Framework Factsheet (172KB PDF)](https://www.cisc.gov.au/resources-subsite/Documents/cisc-factsheet-systems-of-national-significance-enhanced-cyber-security-obligations.pdf).

This obligation will help entities identify what to do and who to call in the event of a cyber incident. It is not intended to address hazards more generally.

The Secretary must give written notice to a responsible entity of a SoNS before applying this obligation. The entity must then adopt, maintain and comply with their incident response plan. The entity must also review the plan on a regular basis.

Before giving a notice, the Secretary must:

-   consider the cost, reasonableness and proportionality and any other matter the Secretary considers relevant
-   consult the entity and any relevant Commonwealth regulator that has functions relating to the security of that system.

If the Secretary does decide to issue a notice, the notice will say when the obligation comes into effect. You will have a minimum 30 day notice period to make arrangements to meet this obligation.

You must provide the Secretary with a copy of the incident response plan as soon as practicable after you adopt it. You must also provide a new copy when any material changes are made to the plan.

There is no mandated template for an incident response plan. Responsible entities are best placed to construct a plan that is suitable for their business, and in many cases will already have plans in place. You should take into account a variety of factors, including:

-   the services provided by the asset
-   the extent and nature of interdependencies
-   the threat environment.

To assist you in meeting the incident response planning obligation, our [Incident Response Planning Guidance (1238KB PDF)](https://www.cisc.gov.au/resources-subsite/Documents/ecso-guidance-incident-response-planning.pdf) includes 'what good looks like' and can be used when developing and reviewing your incident response plan.

You must comply with and regularly review your plan. You must take all reasonable steps to ensure the plan is kept up to date.

The Secretary must give written notice to a responsible entity of a SoNS before applying this obligation. Before giving a notice, the Secretary must:

-   consider the cost, reasonableness and proportionality and any other matter the Secretary considers relevant
-   consult the entity and any relevant Commonwealth regulator that has functions relating to the security of that system.

You will have at least 30 days from when the notice is given to complete the exercises. The Secretary will include an exact period of time in the notice.

Cyber security exercises test the responsible entity’s ability to prepare, respond and reduce the potential harm of either:

-   cyber security incidents in general
-   particular threat scenarios.

There is no one form of cyber security exercise. They can be discussion or tabletop-based, operational or functional. The exercise can test different capabilities, such as:

-   internal response capability
-   responsibilities for key staff
-   coordination mechanisms.

To assist you in meeting this obligation, read the [Enhanced cyber Security Obligation Guidance - Cyber Security Exercise (1034KB PDF)](https://www.cisc.gov.au/resources-subsite/Documents/ecso-guidance-cyber-security-exercises.pdf).

We will work with you to determine what exercise will be most useful. This will depend on the threat environment and the individual characteristics of the asset.

You may also be required to do any or all of the following things:

-   allow one or more specified designated officers to observe the cyber security exercise
-   provide those designated officers with access to premises to observe the cyber security exercise
-   provide those designated officers with reasonable assistance and facilities that are reasonably necessary to allow those designated officers to observe the cyber security exercise
-   allow those designated officers to make such records as are reasonably necessary for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the notice
-   give those designated officers reasonable notice of the time when the cyber security exercise will begin.

A designated officer is an employee of the Department of Home Affairs or a staff member of the Australian Signals Directorate appointed by the Secretary.

Once you have completed an exercise, you must prepare an evaluation report. You must give a copy of this report to the Secretary within 30 days after the completion of the exercise, unless directed otherwise.

In some circumstances, the Secretary may require you to arrange for an evaluation report to be prepared by an external auditor.

You can find the requirements of this report in [section 30CS of the SOCI Act](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2018A00029).

___

There is no set form for a vulnerability assessment. Examples include:

-   a documentation-based review of a system’s design
-   a hands-on assessment
-   automated scanning with software tools.

The Secretary may give notice requiring you to undertake a vulnerability assessment of:

-   the system and all types of cyber security incidents
-   the system and one or more specified types of cyber security incidents.

The Secretary will specify how long you have to complete the assessment in the notice.

Before giving a notice, the Secretary must:

-   consider the cost, reasonableness and proportionality and any other matter the Secretary considers relevant
-   consult the entity and any relevant Commonwealth regulator that has functions relating to the security of that system.

The Secretary may give a designated officer a written request to undertake a vulnerability assessment for you. They will only do this if you are unable or unwilling to do the assessment. A designated officer is an employee of the Department of Home Affairs or a staff member of the Australian Signals Directorate appointed by the Secretary.

In this case, the Secretary will give you written notice requiring you to provide the designated officer with:

-   access to the premises for the purposes of undertaking the vulnerability assessment
-   access to computers for the purposes of undertaking the vulnerability assessment
-   reasonable assistance and facilities that are reasonably necessary to allow the designated officer to undertake the vulnerability assessment.

Once the assessment is completed, the responsible entity (or designated officer) must prepare a vulnerability assessment report. They must give a copy of this report to the Secretary within 30 days after the assessment has been completed. The Secretary may choose to allow a longer period for the report to be provided.

The government may use this report to work with you to identify and implement measures to address any weaknesses.

To assist you in meeting this obligation, read [Enhanced Cyber Security Obligation Guidance - Vulnerability Assessment (1255KB PDF)](https://www.cisc.gov.au/resources-subsite/Documents/enhanced-cyber-security-obligations-guidance-vulnerability-assessments.pdf).

___

System information is data generated about a system for the purposes of security, diagnostic monitoring or audit. It can include information such as:

-   network logs
-   system telemetry and event logs
-   alerts
-   netflow
-   other aggregate or metadata.

It does not include personal information.

There are three types of system information notices that the Secretary may give to a relevant entity for a SoNS. Before giving any notice, the Secretary must:

-   consider the cost, reasonableness and proportionality and any other matter the Secretary considers relevant
-   consult the relevant entity and the responsible entity for the SoNS (if the relevant entity is not the responsible entity).

A relevant entity could refer to a responsible entity, a direct interest holder, the operator of the asset or a managed service provider for the asset.
