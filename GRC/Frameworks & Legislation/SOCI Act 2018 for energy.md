The legal obligations you have if you own, operate, or have direct interests in critical infrastructure assets are outlined in the [_Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018_ (SOCI Act)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2018A00029). It also outlines how the government can support you if an incident occurs that impacts your critical infrastructure asset. 

In the energy sector, responsible entities for all asset classes must comply with the obligation to notify data service providers. They must notify their third-party data storage or processing provider that the provider is storing or processing business critical data for a critical infrastructure asset.

Responsible entities and direct interest holders for critical infrastructure energy sector assets must also comply with the following [positive security obligations](https://www.cisc.gov.au/how-we-support-industry/regulatory-obligations):

-   Provide operational and ownership information to the Register of Critical Infrastructure Assets.
-   Report cyber incidents.
-   Adopt, maintain and comply with a written critical infrastructure risk management program.

If you own or operate a System of National Significance, you may be subject to [Enhanced Cyber Security Obligations](https://www.cisc.gov.au/how-we-support-industry/regulatory-obligations/enhanced-cyber-security-obligations) (ECSO).  

The SOCI Act also includes [Government Assistance measures](https://www.cisc.gov.au/how-we-support-industry/government-assistance). These measures outline how the Government can help industry respond to cyber security incidents. These measures only apply to incidents that will cause serious harm to Australia’s prosperity, national security, or defence.

The energy sector includes stakeholders who work on the:  

-   generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
-   production and delivery of natural gas and liquid fuels.

## Energy critical infrastructure assets

There are four types of critical infrastructure assets within the energy sector:

-   critical electricity assets
-   critical gas assets
-   critical energy market operator assets
-   critical liquid fuel assets.  
    

A critical electricity asset is:

-   a network, system, or interconnector for electricity transmission or distribution for at least 100,000 customers
-   a network, system, or interconnector, that transmits or distributes electricity to at least 100,000 customers
-   an electricity generation station that is critical to ensuring the security and reliability of electricity networks or electricity systems in a state or territory.

In consultation with industry, the definition has been clarified through the Asset Definition Rules:

-   Critical electricity assets will include electricity generators (including batteries and other storage) that have a nameplate generation capacity greater than or equal to 30 megawatts and connected to a wholesale electricity market. This would be a reduction from the current rules.
-   The term ‘synchronous’ be removed from the current Rules to capture renewable generators. We won’t change the existing language of ‘installed capacity’.

___

A critical gas asset is:

-   a gas processing facility that has a capacity of at least 300 terajoules per day
-   a gas storage facility that has a maximum daily quantity of at least 75 terajoules per day
-   a network or system for the distribution of gas to service at least 100,000 customers
-   a gas transmission pipeline that is critical to ensuring the security and reliability of a gas market.

In consultation with industry, the definition has been refined through the _Security of Critical Infrastructure (Definitions) Rules (LIN 21/039) 2021_ to the following:

-   Critical gas transmission pipeline thresholds stay the same as in the current Rules. These include:
    -   Eastern gas market transmission pipelines with nameplate rating of 200 terajoules per day
    -   Northern gas market transmission pipelines with nameplate rating of 80 terajoules per day
    -   Western gas market transmission pipelines with nameplate rating of 150 terajoules per day.
-   The Tasmanian gas pipeline will continue to be prescribed as a critical gas asset.
-   The Carpentaria gas transmission pipeline will become a critical gas asset.

___

A critical energy market operator asset is:

-   owned or operated by:
    -   Australian Energy Market Operator Limited (ACN 072 010 327), or
    -   Power and Water Corporation, or
    -   Regional Power Corporation, or
    -   Electricity Networks Corporation, and
-   used in connection with the operation of an energy market or system, and
-   critical to ensuring the security and reliability of an energy market, but
-   does not include a critical electricity, gas, or liquid fuel asset.

___

A critical liquid fuel asset is a liquid fuel refinery, pipeline or storage facility that is critical to ensuring the security and reliability of a liquid fuel market.

In consultation with industry, the definition has been refined through the _Security of Critical Infrastructure (Definitions) Rules (LIN 21/039) 2021_ to the following:

-   Critical liquid fuel assets will include the major refineries, Geelong and Lytton, as they play a major part in Australia’s fuel supply chain,
-   Critical liquid fuel assets will include the following major liquid fuel pipelines:
    -   Sydney Metropolitan Pipeline (including Silverwater to Newcastle via Plumpton to include the Banksmeadow to Silverwater Pipeline)
    -   Gore Bay Pipeline (Gore Bay to Clyde/Parramatta terminal to include the Viva Energy Mascot Pipeline)
    -   Westernport Altona Geelong (WAG) Pipeline and associated infrastructure (Long Island Point Tank Farm to Altona to Geelong Refinery)
    -   Longford (Dutson) to Hastings Pipeline and associated infrastructure (crude oil from Bass Strait to Long Island Point Tank Farm)
    -   Melbourne Airport Jet Fuel (JUHI) Pipelines (Altona/Newport to Tullamarine via Somerton)
    -   Caltex Jet Fuel Pipeline (Kurnell to Sydney Airport)
    -   Brisbane Jet Fuel (JUHI) Pipelines
    -   Perth Airport Jet Fuel Pipeline.
-   Critical liquid fuel assets will include liquid fuel storage facilities that have storage capacity of more than 50 megalitres.
