# PenTesting

Definition: Penetration testing is a process in which a security professional simulates an attack on a network or computer system to evaluate its security—with the permission of that system's owners AKA _ethical hacking_, _white-hat hacking_, _red-teaming_

## Types



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">External:</span> Simulates what you might imagine as a typical hacker scenario, with an outsider probing into the target organization's perimeter defences to try to find weaknesses to exploit.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Internal:</span> Performed from within the organization’s environment, this test attempts to understand what could happen if the network perimeter were successfully penetrated or what an authorized user could do to penetrate specific information resources within the organization's network.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blind testing:</span> In this case, the tester tries to simulate the actions of a real hacker. The testing team has little or no information about the organization but instead must rely on publicly available information (such as corporate website, domain name registry, etc.) to gather information about the target and conduct its penetration tests.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Double-blind testing:</span> In this exercise, only a few people within the organization are made aware of the testing. The IT and security staff are not notified or informed beforehand, and as such, they are "blind" to the planned testing activities. Double-blind testing helps test an organization's security monitoring and incident identification processes, as well as its escalation and response procedures.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Targeted testing:</span> Also known as the lights-turned-on approach, target testing involves both IT and penetration testing teams. Testing activities and information concerning the target and the network design are known going in. Targeted tests require less time and effort than a blind test, but typically don’t provide as complete a picture of an organization's security vulnerabilities and response capabilities as other testing strategies.

Box Types

* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black</span>: PenTest team knows nothing about the target 
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">White</span>: PenTest team have access to all sorts of system artifacts, including source code, binaries, containers, and sometimes even the servers running the system; the goal is to _determine how hardened the target systems_ are in the face of a truly _knowledgeable insider looking to escalate their permissions_ to get at valuable data.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Grey</span>: Somewhere in-between to simulate a real-world attacker's likely preliminary knowledge.

* **[Pre-engagement interactions](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement)**: As we've noted, any pen test should be preceded by the testers and target organization establishing the scope and goals of the test, preferably in writing.
* **[Intelligence gathering](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Intelligence_Gathering)**: The tester should begin by performing reconnaissance against a target to gather as much information as possible, a process that may include gathering so-called _[open source intelligence](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3445357/what-is-osint-top-open-source-intelligence-tools.html), _or publicly available information, about the target organization.
* **[Threat modeling](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Threat_Modeling)**: In this phase, the pen tester should model the capabilities and motivations behind a potential real attacker, and try to determine what targets within the target organization might attract that attacker's attention.
* **[Vulnerability analysis](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Vulnerability_Analysis)**: This is probably the core of what most people think about when it comes to penetration testing: analyzing the target organization's infrastructure for security flaws that will allow a hack.
* **[Exploitation](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Exploitation)**: In this phase, the pen tester uses the vulnerabilities they've discovered to enter the target organization's systems and exfiltrate data. The goal here is not just to breach their perimeter, but to bypass active countermeasures and remain undetected for as long as possible.
* **[Post exploitation](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Post_Exploitation)**: In this phase, the pen tester attempts to maintain control of the systems they've breached and ascertain their value. This can be a particularly delicate phase in regard to the relationship between the pen testers and their clients; it is important here that the pre-engagement interactions in the first phase produced a well-defined set of ground rules that will protect the client and ensure that no essential client services are negatively affected by the test.
* **[Reporting](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Reporting)**: Finally, the tester must be able to deliver a comprehensive and informative report to their client about the risks and vulnerabilities they discovered. _CSO _spoke to a number of security pros about the [traits and skills an ethical hacker should have](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3637732/10-essential-skills-and-traits-of-ethical-hackers.html), and many of them said that the communication skills necessary to clearly convey this information is close to the top of the list.
